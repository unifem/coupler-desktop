Welcome to the Docker image for Multiphysics Coupler!
This image is based on Ubuntu 16.04, with FEniCS 2017.1.0, SciPy and
Spyder for Python 3.5.2, Jupyter Notebook, and g++-5.4 preinstalled.

Please save your code and data into the ~/shared or ~/project directories.
The former maps to the current work directory on your computer. The latter
maps to the Docker data volume named coupler_project on your host.

To use git with ssh authentication, make sure the ssh key on your host
computer is in bitbucket and github, and then run "ssh-add" in this terminal
to add your ssh key to the ssh-agent.
